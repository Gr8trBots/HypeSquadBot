It knew nothing but destruction, so humanity was pretty ðŸ’€. \nUntil a young sage... cool sage, found a weird totem of an unusual animal. I forgot what it's called... *it'sa wumpus!* And the sage touched the thing! When he touched it, this crazy light just came out of it, and flew up in the sky, and hurt the evil spirit! It was pretty cool! A person was there!\nAnd then out of the light, three heroes emerged... to fight the evil spirit! And they did, and they won this time! And after that, the humanity was **SO** hyped, that they formed three houses, to celebrate the victories of the heroes against the evil dudes! Today, the houses are collectively known as the **HypeSquad**. \n- Got from An Old Scroll found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWzB1mx2o5k)")
